## Day Planner

## Description

I made this day palnner for the University of Richmond Bootcamp Homework #5.  I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and Javascript to code this page, and used Github pages to deploy the final application. This can be used to plan your work day from 9AM to 5pm.  The task are stored to local storage and will stay in on the planner when the page is refreshed.  

As a someone who has a job.
I need to plan out my day hour by hour.
So I do not fall behind in my work.
